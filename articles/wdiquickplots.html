<a href="#bubble-plot" class="anchor"></a>Bubble plot</h1>
<p>A quick-to-create bubble plot. Basically a function to produce a scatter plot and you pass the codes for the indicators you want in the x and y axis, as well as the indicator to map the size of the markers to.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example showing public health expenditure vs. risk of catastrophic health expenditure.</p>

<p>An although you can convert the static bubble plot to an interactive one (e.g. using plotly::ggplotly), those automatic conversions usually leave a few things that could be better. Thus, there is also an interactive version, powered by <code>plotly</code>.</p>
