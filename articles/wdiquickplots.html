<p>Similar as the distribution plot, quickly shows where the highlighted countries stand in comparison with the rest of the world (without using any country groups). This one is interactive so you can explore a bit (e.g. zooming in and out or see the exact value of the indicator for each country as tooltip).</p>

<p>A quick-to-create bubble plot. Basically a function to produce a scatter plot and you pass the codes for the indicators you want in the x and y axis, as well as the indicator to map the size of the markers to.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example showing public health expenditure vs. risk of catastrophic health expenditure.</p>

<p>There is a static version, powered by <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>

<p>An although you can convert the static bubble plot to an interactive one (e.g. using plotly::ggplotly), those automatic conversions usually leave a few things that could be better. Thus, there is also an interactive version, powered by <code>plotly</code>.</p>
